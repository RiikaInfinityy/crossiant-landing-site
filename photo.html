        A croissant is a buttery, flaky, French viennoiserie pastry inspired by
        the shape of the Austrian kipferl but using the French yeast-leavened
        laminated dough.Croissants are named for their historical crescent
        shape, the dough is layered with butter, rolled and folded several times
        in succession, then rolled into a thin sheet, in a technique called
        laminating. The process results in a layered, flaky texture, similar to
        a puff pastry.
      </p>

        Crescent-shaped breads have been made since the Renaissance, and
        crescent-shaped cakes possibly since antiquity but using brioche dough.
        Kipferls have long been a staple of Austrian, and French bakeries and
        pâtisseries. The modern croissant was developed in the early 20th
        century when French bakers replaced the brioche dough of the kipferl
        with a yeast-leavened laminated dough. In the late 1970s, the
        development of factory-made, frozen, preformed but unbaked dough made
        them into a fast food that could be freshly baked by unskilled labor.
        The croissant bakery, notably the La Croissanterie chain, was a French
        response to American-style fast food, and as of 2008, 30–40% of the
        croissants sold in French bakeries and patisseries were baked from
        frozen dough.

        Croissants are a common part of a continental breakfast in many European
        countries.
